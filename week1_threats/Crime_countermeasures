Measures I use to increase my security:
* KeePassXC password manager
* Hardware authenticaion (when I'm not too lazy to set it up)
* 2FA for every service that is valuable to me, too lazy to set it up for random things I do not care about
* UBlock Origin to not get malicious advertisments
* Own best practices, not downloading suspicous files (if so mess around in a VM)
* Keep my sw updated

Victim of cybercrime:
* I infected the family PC with quite a few bits of malware back in the day doing stupid things. Had to remove a cryptominer once that I got from messing up.

* I could improve on so many things: Run everything as a container, keep personal / work & school stuff separate, follow news about exploits more to know about them...
